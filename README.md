## blRstr: A ReSTIR/RTXDI-based Blender Render Engine.

~~This is the support and beta release repository for [blRstr](https://stkrake.de/blRstr). Please note that this is not an open source project.
It just uses issues and releases to manage (binary) beta releases. The open source part of blRstr will get its own repository.~~

(All of) blRstr will become open source! (but no ETA yet...). Learn more: [https://stkrake.net/ossrstr/](https://stkrake.net/ossrstr/)
